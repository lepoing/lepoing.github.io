I'm Minh Nguyen a web developer and passionate for open source development. I'm curently working as a Javascript fullstack with AngularJS and NodeJS.

I enjoy learning new languages, technologies and do some side projects in my free time because I want to develop my set skills as a full-stack developer. My favorite quote is "Together nothing is imposible".
